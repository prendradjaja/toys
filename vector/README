This class allows convenient arithmetic for vectors. I mainly intend to use
this for Advent of Code. (Authored 2023 after AoC 2023. Try this out next
year!)

For example, instead of writing this ...

    def get_position(initial_position, velocity, time):
        return addvec(
            initial_position,
            mulvec(velocity, time)
        )

... we can write this:

    def get_position(initial_position, velocity, time):
        return initial_position + velocity * time

For more details, see tests.txt (which doubles as documentation)

Alternatives:
- Use NumPy
    - Advantages of vector.py: No virtualenv. No startup time.
    - Disadvantages of vector.py: Copy & paste.
- Use addvec mulvec etc

Not implemented:
- division, because there's more possibilities: float division, floor
  division, modulo... (implement later if needed)

This directory also contains:
- tests.txt (which doubles as documentation)
- A few example programs from Advent of Code 2023 (which double as additional
  tests)

Tests can be run via run-tests.sh.
