. detect terminal width and adjust MAX_BOARDS_PER_ROW accordingly
. add win rate tests
. learn: choose_random_move has a small (3%?) win rate as P1 against simple3. what do these games look like?

Interesting: simple3 beats choose_leftmost_move more quickly than simple2, but
simple2 beats simple3 -- probably because both avoid "mate in 1" but simple2's
placements give more flexibility than simple3's.
