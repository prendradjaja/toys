1. A simple game: Start with a random rack of Scrabble tiles, e.g.

  SATUDRE

2. Make a word out of them. This is your new rack.

  STARED

3. Remove the first letter and draw a random tile from the (infinite) bag.

  TAREDH

4. Go back to step 2 and repeat until you can no longer make a word, e.g.

  DEARTH -> EARTHX
  HEART -> EARTP
  PART -> ARTD
  DART -> ARTZ
  TAR -> ARX
  A -> E
  (game over)


REMARKS:

A small amount of animation in a GUI environment would probably make it more
obvious what happens at each turn.

This is not a very fun game.
