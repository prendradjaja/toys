[Verse]
G                     C
I don’t wanna say goodbye like this
G                                  C
I’m watching as your face begins to fade
Em                                      C
The last six months are waiting with its engine on
G                     C
Our ugly rebounds waiting in their caves


[Chorus]
                  G
So meet me on the bridge
      D            C
We’ll hand over our hostages
              G
A fake silver ring
     D               C
Your books in foreign languages
                 Em
You can keep the coat
   D               C
It looks better on you
            Am
Anyway, I’m fine
            C                 G
I guess the cold’s a state of mind


[Post-Chorus]
Dm C       G
Two lovers met
Dm C          G
Two strangers left


[Refrain]
            Em             C
You say I’m dead on the inside
           G                D
Babe, I’ve known that for a while
       Em                C
And It wasn’t like you liked me
       G              D
For my sunny views on life
        Em             C
Oh, I’m dead on the inside
           G                D
Babe, I’ve known that all along
    Em              C
Any time I tried to love you
         G
I got it wrong


[Chorus]
                  G
So meet me on the bridge
      D            C
We’ll hand over our hostages
                  G
Your dad’s broken watch
  D             C
A letter to your old address
                 Em
You just stay so cool
   D               C
It looks better on you
            Am
Anyway, I’m fine
        C                  G
I guess alone’s a state of mind


[Post-Chorus]
Dm C       G
And two lovers met
Dm C          G
Two strangers left


[Refrain]
            Em             C
You say I’m dead on the inside
           G                D
Babe, I’ve known that for a while
       Em                C
And It wasn’t like you liked me
       G              D
For my sunny views on life
        Em             C
Oh, I’m dead on the inside
           G                D
Babe, I’ve known that all along
    Em              C
Any time I tried to love you
         G
I got it wrong


[Chorus]
                  G
So meet me on the bridge
      D            C
We’ll hand over our hostages
               G
We’ll shed our skin
    D           C
And fade into acquaintances
               Em
This is how we die
  D                 C
Become just you and I
                   Am
You turn round and smile
          C       Am
One final time
         C               G
You were just a state of mind

[Post-Chorus]
Dm C       G
And two lovers met
Dm C          G
Two strangers left

[Verse 1]
       Ebmaj7      Bbm7           Eb7        Abmaj7
Look at me, I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree;
                  Abm9            Db7
And I feel like I'm clingin' to a cloud,
  Ebmaj7      Cm7
I can't understand
     Fm7           Bb7         Gm7     C7     Fm7    Bb7
I get misty, just holding your hand.


[Verse 2]
       Ebmaj7
Walk my way,
      Bbm7        Eb7            Abmaj7
And a thousand violins begin to play,
                   Abm9          Db7
Or it might be the sound of your hello,
     Ebmaj7  Cm7
That music I hear,
      Fm7        Bb7           Eb6
I get misty, the moment you're near.


[Bridge]
                          Bbm7               Eb7b9
Can't you see that you're leading me on?
                     Abmaj7
And it's just what I want you to do,
                      Am7                 D7
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost
               F7            Gm7b5    C7b9    Fm7    Bb7
That's why I'm following you.


[Verse 3]
      Ebmaj7
On my own,
       Bbm7                 Eb7       Abmaj7
When I wander through this wonderland alone,
                  Abm9               Db7
Never knowing my right foot from my left
   Ebmaj7      Cm7
My hat from my glove
         Fm7       Bb7         Ebmaj7
I'm too misty, and too much in love.
     Fm7       Bb7
Too misty,
                Ebmaj7
And too much in love...

[Verse 1]
         F        Faug
There's no sunshine
       F6         Faug
This impossible year
      F             Faug
Only black days and sky grey
     F6             F7
And clouds full of fear
     Bb            F6/A
And storms full of sorrow
     Dm   Dm7     G7
That won't disappear
     F/C          Faug/C#
Just typhoons and monsoons
       Dm       Eb
This impossible year

[Verse 2]
           Bb         Bbaug
There's no good times
       Bb6         Bbaug
This impossible year
       Bb            Bbaug
Just a beachfront of bad blood
      Bb6          Bb7
And a coast that's unclear
        Eb            Bb6/D
All the guests at the party
        Gm      C7
They're so insincere
          Bb/F          Bbaug/F#
They just intrude and exclude
       Gm             Ab
This impossible year

[Verse 3]
           Eb         Ebaug
There's no you and me
       Eb6         Ebaug
This impossible year
      Eb           Ebaug
Only heartache and heartbreak
    Eb6       Eb7
And gin made of tears
    Ab            Eb/G
The bitter pill I swallow
    Cm         F7
The scars souvenir
     Eb/Bb           Ebaug/B
That tattoo, your last bruise
       Cm       Db
This impossible year

[Bridge]
              Ab
There's never air to breathe
              Cm/G
There's never in-betweens
      Fm                Ab/Eb               Bb/D    Bb/C    Bb
These nightmares always hang on past the dream

[Intro]

 C#m                      E         B               A
Long ago, just like the hearse you died to get in again,
   C#m     B
We are so far from you.


[Verse 1]

 C#m                     E          B            A
Burning on, just like a match you strike to incinerate
     C#m             B
the lives, of every one you knew.
              G#m       A                C#m        B
And whats the worst to take, from every heart you break.
        G#m        A               C#m    B        E
like a blade you stain, I've been holding on tonight.


[Chorus]

 E                           B              Cdim        C#m
Whats the worst thing I can say? Things are better if I stay.
                B                      E
So long and goodnight, so long and goodnight!


[Verse 2]

C#m                      E            B                   A
Came a time, where every star fall brought you to tears again.
   C#m           B
we are the very hurt you sold.
               G#m      A                C#m       B
And whats the worst to take, from every heart you break.
        G#m       A                C#m    B       E
like a blade you stain, I've been holding on tonight.


[Chorus]

E                           B               Cdim        C#m
Whats the worst thing I can say? Things are better if I stay.
                Cdim                   E
So long and goodnight, so long and goodnight!
  E                      B                         C#m
And if I carry on this way, thing are better if I stay.
                Cdim                   E
So long and goodnight, so long and goodnight!


[Bridge]

C#m  A   E   B
Can you hear me?
C#m  A   E   B
Are you near me?
C#m      A          E        B
Can we pretend to leave and then,
      C#m    A         E        B
We'll meet again when both our cars collide!


[Chorus]

E                           B               Cdim        C#m
Whats the worst thing I can say? Things are better if I stay.
               Cdim                    E
So long and goodnight, so long and goodnight!
E                           B            Cdim        C#m
Well if you carry on this way, thing are better if I stay.
               Cdim                    E
So long and goodnight, so long and goodnight!
